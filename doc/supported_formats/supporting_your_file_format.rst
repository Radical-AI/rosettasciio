Supporting Your File Format
===========================

Many companies have decided to support their own file formats and we strongly support and encourage this.
This helps ensure that the data is being read correctly and often allow for more complete file reading.
If you are a user of HyperSpy and have a file format that you would like to support, please consider
contacting the company to ask them to support their file format in HyperSpy.

The following is a list of companies that are currently or have previously supported the reading/writing
of their file formats in HyperSpy.  We'd like to thank them for their support and continued commitments to open
file formats.

.. note:: We are always looking for more companies to support their file formats.
   If you are a company that would like to support your file format or have previously supported it,
   please raise an issue on GitHub or contact us!
